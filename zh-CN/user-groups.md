# Rust 用户组

There are more than 90 Rust User Groups worldwide in over 35
countries. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User Groups. Its a
great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and
socialize with other people with a similar interest.  Meetings are
usually informal and open to everyone. If you have started a new user
group and wish to add it to this list, please contact the [Rust Community Team](./team.html#Community-team) or
even better, open a pull request against [this website](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-www/blob/master/_data/usergroups.yml).
